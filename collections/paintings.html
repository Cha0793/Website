        <h1>Planting Rice</h1>
        <img src="images/plantingrice.jpg" alt="Planting Rice">
        <h2>Fernando Amorsolo | Planting Rice | 1921 | Oil on canvas <br> </h2>
        <p>This 1921 oil painting by Fernando Amorsolo is the earliest known version of a series titled "Planting Rice," created between 1921 and 1944. Amorsolo's highly sensualized depictions of women farmers shift the narrative from a simple portrayal of agrarian economic production to a more nuanced association of agriculture with female fertility and reproductive sexuality.</p>
        <div class="trivia-paintings">
            <p>Trivia: Amorsolo’s "Planting Rice" is a reinterpretation of Fabian de la Rosa’s 1904 award-winning piece from the Saint Louis World’s Exposition, but it is set in a more suburban environment.</p>

        <p>This work by Hidalgo depicts a historical event: the assassination of Governor-General Fernando Bustamante y Bustillo in 1719 by a mob led by friars whose economic interests were threatened by his policies. The scene is set in the old Palacio del Gobernador in Intramuros.</p>
        <div class="trivia-paintings">
            <p>Trivia: The painting was commissioned by Don Antonio Ma. Regidor (1845-1910), a nationalist known for his opposition to the ministers. However, Regidor was unable to take the painting, which remained with Hidalgo in Barcelona until 1914.</p>
